## **Question 1: Does typical compensation for Data Science professionals differ among densely populated and sparsely populated areas? (‘Dense’ definition >12,000 per square mile; ‘sparse’ definition <6,000 per square mile). **

### *Define density by following metrics country population, number of entries per country, number of entries per title (i.e 7000 Data Scientist vs 3000 Data Engineer)*

### *Use ANOVA to test possible differences in multiple groups and Linear Regression to test if there is a linear relationship between compensation and the density of groups. *

### *Test level of power data set allows for our research given the n number of responses.*
